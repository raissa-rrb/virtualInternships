# Virtual Internships
Forage.com offers some Software Engineer Job Simulations with different level of difficulty.

## EA software engineer
I did the EA sofwtare Engineer job simulation which is of easy to intermediate level and it was pretty fun.
It consisted of making a class diagram, coming up with some feature proposals and how to structure them and some code to implement the feature proposal idea and to do some debug. 
I uploaded the code and there's a markdown file with my ideas and notes. 

I'll do more soon :)
